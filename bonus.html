            <p> Philadelphia’s USFL team won’t play in its hometown for at least two years, but the Stars, who kick off their season today as part of the experimental spring football league, found an early way to endear themselves to fans.

                The franchise let people vote on what to call the mascot — and actually stuck with the winning answer. Yep, the city’s newest sports icon is named Blob.
                
                It’s a fitting name for the amorphous red creature, which looks like what you’d get if McDonald’s Grimace had a baby with a giant Minion. (Other options were “Astro” and “Cosmo,” both deathly boring). The mischievous expression on Blob’s face falls somewhere between Gritty’s provocative glare and the Phanatic’s gleeful grin..
